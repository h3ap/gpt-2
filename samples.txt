======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
 :p It was very nice to see how excited my husband was about doing a full ride on the horses that ran behind us."

The pair went through the car parks as they were walking on the highway.

"I guess my wife needed to keep our house clean for this, but I think her house should be clean too," Pippa replied with a smile.

According to an eyewitness who saw the horse run, "I remember trying to turn it over on the way into the driveway but seeing some horses jump out of the carriage and fall onto the driveway. He also stopped to help as he said 'I'm sorry,' and they all ran away."

The horse then left the house and Pippa and her dog found it several days later in an area with more horses on horseback.

The couple said they also saw the whole thing in what they called a "very rough area" in the area where a man jumped a few fences.

A witness also said that "the horse did not run after them but jumped on the roof and out of the way".<|endoftext|>Faced with the massive deficit facing the Department of Treasury, Republicans have unveiled an ambitious plan to combat global warming.

The plan to slash the federal debt is set to cost $22.6 trillion by 2017 -- or $1.8 trillion less than what the Obama administration projected.

On paper, the tax plan is an ideal way to cut interest rates. But as the budget process moves deeper into debate, Republicans are looking to break with that path -- or at least make it less appealing.

"In an ideal world, every plan that we release would be the kind of revenue-neutral, tax-cut-friendly plan that our government always tries to reach for in government spending," said Senator Ron Paul of Texas.

Republicans released a plan that is similar to the Republican Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but it includes some key changes to federal programs.

It will reduce the deficit by $200 billion over 10 years while increasing tax rates by $15.

It includes some savings that would help offset the federal deficit, which has increased from $3 trillion in 2010 to $5 trillion in 2015. It also includes some reductions in the cost of Medicaid and other public assistance programs.

"We're going to make it more expensive to keep people safe every time people want them to be, but it's an alternative to keeping people here," said Representative James Posey, R

There's little to no reason why you should be given anything but a free shirt. It's so much work.

"My mother would have wanted me to wear a shirt at my wedding, but she kept her promise to get me one by getting my parents to pay for it," he said.

Holly, who works as an information technology consultant and is now working as a writer, says that she is proud of all the people who helped her find her job.

"I remember how much I wanted to have something," she said. "It helped me with school, work, family. I remember how much time I spent on my work, how many things saved my life. Now when I take over a job I want to work like any other job: I like to be around people."

The full cost of the shirt is $25 per hour, which makes sense, given that her father is a paid consultant and was required to pay for it himself.

The idea that a free shirt is a great idea is something Holly shared with some colleagues who are paying attention, and has been encouraging others. He says she has taken a good hard look at the cost model.

He says, to many members of the media, the picture of free shirt is of the poor, the unemployed, and the "low-paid" and "marginally employed.

"We're not selling a product to you, or we're going to raise your rent," he says. "But we're not raising your wages just because we're looking to sell a product."

Holly says she started wearing a t-shirt just to have an idea, but she knows what she'll be getting when she gets her daughter to take part in this initiative.

"She should get some help from family. I wouldn't want her to lose her job just because of what she did. She couldn't afford to keep paying $15 an hour or $15 an hour, when that is what she got, from someone so much like her," he said.<|endoftext|>The Washington Post's The "Gang of Eight" featured what appears to be a video on YouTube of the two men laughing and joking.

 Why don't you tell me."

She sat down in bed to rest in her chair, thinking of what she'd done there. Then she thought of the other students who'd done it for her. She would talk to her friends.

"You're welcome."

"Good morning, Miss Granger. We're on your lunch date, so the others are all very excited. Can you tell me why you're so interested in going here?"

"What? I didn't want to leave? I guess I don't want to get married because it takes more than an hour of our time together. But, I know there could be other students that you can meet. They just might want to meet some new students. I want them to meet people that are willing and able to give them answers. The professor just told us you're going to meet there first,"

"I'm sorry I told you." Her eyes were red. She felt she might have gotten something wrong. "But I know. I got it. I've been here once." She tried again, but her face turned dark. "No, you didn't. We're not allowed to. This is not where we want to be."

"Right, I'm sorry! I won't tell other students. We'll have to talk about it later, but there has to be a better way."

"Yes, Miss Granger."

"So I'll be on your lunch date."

"Yeah but you have to work that out yourself. So go see with them. As I've written earlier, I've never been at Hogwarts, yet I'm interested by the people there. The people around it are all good, I know that. But I can say this: I'm not interested in being on your lunch date. I'm interested in meeting people. I don't hate these people, and I really don't want to talk to them. But I feel I've been lied to that I'm very much attracted to them and I don't want to leave any stone unturned. So I told the professor how I had been attracted by their faces, that I'd never been attracted to anyone before that school, and I'd never wanted to see someone else. Just like that. They laughed. But not for long. They laughed for the rest of the day. Then, after dinner, they said goodbye. They gave each other good wishes. Then, after a while it started to rain again. Eventually

The job opening rate hit 19.8 percent last year, and that's just about the lowest level since the financial crisis.

Those unemployment rates are about 8.5 percent, and have barely budged in four years.

The unemployment rate in the U.S. was 5.1 percent last year.

The number of Americans looking for work has fallen steadily in recent years.

"It is time to move on from the current economic crisis," said Ryan Grimaldi, director of the Institute for Government Quarterly.

But he is pessimistic about the prospects for economic growth and job creation.
